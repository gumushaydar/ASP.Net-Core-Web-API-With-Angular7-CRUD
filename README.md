# ASP.Net-Core-Web-API-With-AngularJS-CRUD

In this my hobby project, I've coded a web api with ASP.Net core in the backend side. It's basically employee register web app.You can add employees
in the database(sql server).In the frontend side, I've used AngularJS 7. I'm not very good at angular, i am just trying to improve myself in frontend side too.
